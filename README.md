# What is API Versioning?
We all know that changes to our APIs are unavoidable. Managing the impact of these changes is crucial in order not to break any existing clients that use our APIs, but also be able to support new clients. With API versioning, we can develop new versions of our service that new clients will be able to consume, while keeping our existing clients working.
